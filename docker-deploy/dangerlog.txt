1. HTTP protocol exception:
a. Bad Request: 
If our proxy receives a request from the client which does not contain the protocol “HTTP/1.1”, 
we would throw exception to indicate that situation

b. 502 Bad Gateway: If our proxy receives an invalid response(like invalid format) from an origin server, 
we would throw exception to indicate that situation

2. Delete Danger
When we write proxy run function, we create main thread, firstly we delete that main thread, and found that 
proxy can not connect correctly, and then we did not write delete, and then the bug is fixed, so we knew that
Main thread delete will crash other threads
